        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            With a potent 401-hp turbocharged five-cylinder engine, the
            2022 Audi RS3 <br />is the raciest version of the company's small
            luxury sedan. Based on <br />the four-door Audi A3 and the sportier
            S3–but blessed with even more <br />power and enhanced chassis tuning–the
            new RS variant challenges hi-po rivals <br />such as the BMW M2 coupe and
            Mercedes-AMG CLA45 sedan. However, the <br />RS3's unusual engine gives it
            one of the most distinct soundtracks in <br />its class. The Audi's sharply
            creased sheetmetal as well as its stylish,<br /> nicely appointed interior
            help it appeal to audiences who appreciate <br />sportiness as much as
            luxuriousness.
        </p>

    <h3>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h3>
    <p>

        One of the most distinct elements of the RS3 is its unusual five-cylinder<br />
        engine. Its odd number of cylinders give it a unique thrumming soundtrack <br />
        that was particularly pleasing on the outgoing model. The latest iteration <br />
        is again a turbocharged 2.5-liter, but it now makes 401 horsepower­. The <br />
        engine pairs with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that <br />
        deliberately downshifts with slight throttle inputs, but it behaves less <br />
        aggressively during hard braking. Its standard all-wheel-drive system includes <br />
        a torque-vectoring rear differential with a drift mode. Unfortunately, getting <br />
        the RS3's tail to kick out requires dedication and can be difficult to maintain. <br />
        Compared with the lesser A3 and S3, the sportiest 3 has upgraded brakes, a stiffer <br />
        suspension setup, and a unique set of wheels on stickier performance tires. The RS3 <br />
        we drove produced exhilarating sounds, and the car's feisty nature was evident at <br />
        the racetrack. Plus, it was composed and comfortable when driven sedately on regular roads.

    <h4>
        Fuel Economy and Real World MPG
    </h4>
    <p>
        The 2022 RS3 is rated at 19 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway. <br />
        Once we can test one on our 75-mph fuel-economy route, which is part of <br />
        our extensive testing regimen, we can evaluate its real-world mpg. For <br />
        more information about the RS3's fuel-economy, visit the EPA website.

    <h5>
        Interior, Comfort, and Cargo
    </h5>
    <p>
        Inside, the RS3's passenger space is identical to the A3 and S3, <br />
        but it has a set of more aggressively bolstered front seats. Audi <br />
        endows all versions with a dashboard that looks anything but bland. <br />
        A pair of high-mounted air vents face the driver and flank the instrument <br />
        panel binnacle that houses a set of digital gauges. The RS3 is also available <br />
        with a heads-up display. Below the center touchscreen are climate controls with <br />
        physical buttons, and there's a bin below them that's integrated into the center <br />
        console. Unfortunately, drivers have to select gears via a weird, stubby shifter; <br />
        paddles on the steering wheel are an alternative once the RS3 is in motion.

    <h6>
        Infotainment and Connectivity
    </h6>
    <p>
        Based on the infotainment system employed by the A3 and S3, the <br />
        RS3 has a 10.1-inch touchscreen mounted in the middle of the dash. <br />
        It can be controlled through touch inputs, buttons on the steering <br />
        wheel, and voice commands. It also includes wireless Apple CarPlay <br />
        and Android Auto. Built-in navigation, a subscription-based Wi-Fi <br />
        hotspot, and wireless phone charging are on the roster, too.
