            Dodge is one of the oldest car companies in the world, founded in 1900, i.e. the company is over 120 years old, Dodge specializes in making cars with very strong performance, and Dodge cars are the hardest to drive among all sports cars.

        These cars are not new in the automotive world, but some modifications have been made to them, making their performance scary and strong.

    <h1 id="ip">Dodge Charger Hellcat</h1>
     <p class="rt">
        The previous version of the car was coming with a 6200 CCM-shaped engine, horsepower and torque of 881 Nm, this engine connected with an 8-speed fit, the car was very powerful but the company was not content with all this power but developed the engine
        It's a good sedan for families and for everyday use (regardless of fuel consumption), and it's a sports car that delivers very strong performance.
     </p>
     <div class="t">

     </div>
     <div class="rt">
         <p>
            The new version of the car comes with the same engine but gives an estimated 797 hp and torque of up to N958.m, and the car's insatiable fission, the car with all this excessive power can accelerate in 3.5 seconds,
             and reach 200 km/h in just 10 and a half seconds. With all this power, 
             the car has been able to be the fastest sedan in the world, but with all this power the car cannot be practical or fuel-efficient, as the car consumes 17.6 liters per 100 km inside the city

           But when the car is used mathematically (and that's certainly what's going to happen), the car will consume fuel very heavily and can empty the tank, which has a capacity of up to 70 liters in less than a quarter of an hour.

     <h1>Dodge Durango Hellcat</h1>
     <div class="rt">
         <p>   
          The other car developed by Dodge is the Durango Hellcat, the car comes with the same Dodge Charger Helcat engine of 6200 CC with 8-cylinder shape, but gives 710 hp power and torque of 874 NT.
         </p>
     </div>
     <div class="rt">
         <p>          
           It also comes with the same 8-speed phonies, the car can accelerate in 3.5 seconds, and reach 0 to 200 km/h in 11.5 seconds

            The car is the fastest crossover in the world, and it is considered the strongest, where the car can pull the weight of 3 tons without any problems because of the terrible power that this engine gives the car comes with multiple propulsion systems but these systems do not affect the engine and the suspension system and transmission only, but the propulsion system varies according to each system, we find that when walking normally the force is divided by half between the wheels

         <p>
            When using sports, the largest power of rear wheels is 60%, but when the ringing system increases the power of the rear wheels and reaches 65%, this affects very significantly the stability of the car and its cohesion on the road the car is considered family in the first place where it comes with a load enough for seven passengers with very large storage spaces, as the car comes with a rear bag sized 487 liters if the three rows open, but when folding the third row of seats The area is up to 1360 liters

         <p>   
          Since the car is family, it comes with all the safety systems that make it safe on the road for families, where it comes with radar and sensors in all aspects of the car and cameras to maintain the path of the car and give the driver warnings, and it comes brakes from Primbo company that make the car exceed the speed of 100 km/h in only 33 meters as an average depending on the quality of the road and the tire
