        <p>Even more output, even more power: The epitome of performance</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Heikal4">
        <p>Positioned between the axles, the 5.2 FSI engine is at the heart of the Audi R8. It boosts the character of
            the vehicle with its unrestrained power – a maximum of 560 Nm of torque is available at 6200 revolutions per
            minute, proving a close relationship with high-tech racing cars. The special ignition sequence for the 10
            cylinders ultimately leads to an utterly characteristic sound: a throaty hissing and roaring noise.

        <p class="Heikal6"> The combination of MMI navigation plus and Audi virtual cockpit that comes as standard is
            designed to make all functions easy to operate, without you having to take your hands off the wheel or your
            eyes off the road. On the 12.3-inch display of the Audi virtual cockpit, the focus is on a rev counter
            around which other performance values can be arranged, such as torque, G-forces, lap times, engine and gear
            oil temperatures plus tyre pressure and temperature. There is also an additional button available for the
            Audi R8 Coupé V10 performance that enables you to directly control specially configured performance
            programmes.

            The exceptional comfort that accompanies the Audi R8 reveals itself even before entering the car, as the
            digital key completely eliminates the use of the traditional key for entry. Innovative technologies such as
            the driver assistance systems in the Audi Personal CoPilot personal assistance system, and other advanced
            ConnectedDrive services, help to enhance the joy while driving. Meanwhile, the leading educational
            entertainment system with hand gesture control is constantly being updated thanks to the remote software
            update feature.

            Its proximity to racing is also noticeable in the interior of the Audi R8: directly in front of you, a
            large, contoured arc visually encompasses all the controls. Heated sports seats are electrically and
            pneumatically adjustable and upholstered in high-quality Nappa leather. For the Audi R8 Coupé V10 quattro,
            new colour combinations are available with no limit to individual requests.
