               <p>
                The Mistra was first teased as a concept vehicle at the 2013 Shanghai Auto Show and was launched as a production model in the end of 2013, as a model of 2014.[4] It was developed with the Chinese market in mind but may be produced for other markets in the near future.

                The Mistra was conceived as a premium compact vehicle, a popular and growing niche within the Chinese automobile market which typically includes, a longer wheelbase, extended rear legroom, higher quality interior trim, and luxury features usually not available on compact vehicles. Included amongst the features of the Mistra are real wood trim and metal trim, an LCD instrument display and leather interior.
